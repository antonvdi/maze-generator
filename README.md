Skrives i Python 3.8.1

# Brief introduction
This project uses Depth First Search (DFS) to generate a custom, random maze with an exit and entry point. The walls and tracks have a custom and common width. The algorithm shows the generation process on the screen, rendering it using the Pygame library, and export the maze to a folder (/mazes). The algorithm is implemented using a stack, and the program is written in Python 3.8.1.
